## Project Overview

1.Why are buildings such a big deal in energy consumption?
Because they account for nearly 40% of global energy use! Every time we heat, cool, or light up a building, energy demand skyrockets.

2.Can we make buildings smarter and greener?
Yes! By using Machine Learning, we can predict a building’s heating and cooling needs before it’s even built — saving money and reducing carbon emissions.

3.How does this project help?
This project builds an ML model that takes features like wall area, roof area, glazing, and orientation… and then predicts the energy requirements. That means we can identify designs that are energy-efficient without expensive trial and error.

4.Why does it matter?
Because it’s not just about buildings — it’s about creating sustainable cities, reducing climate impact, and ensuring a greener future.
